# FutureRoots — AWS Deployment (Phase 5)

Region: **us-east-1** · Account: the one configured in `aws configure` · IaC: CDK (`infra/`)

## Architecture deployed

- **VPC** — 2 AZs: public (NAT), private-with-egress (Lambda), isolated (RDS). Egress via a **fck-nat t4g.nano instance** (~$3/mo vs $32 managed NAT) so Lambda reaches Stripe/SES/AI APIs; S3 keeps the free gateway endpoint so media bypasses the NAT.
- **RDS PostgreSQL 16** `db.t4g.micro`, 20 GB gp3, single-AZ, 7-day backups. **No public endpoint** — only the API Lambda's security group can reach port 5432.
- **Lambda** (`python3.13`, 512 MB) running FastAPI via Mangum, deployed from `apps/api/build/lambda.zip`, inside the VPC.
- **HTTP API Gateway** fronting the Lambda.
- **S3 media bucket** — private, SSE, presigned PUT/GET (media bytes never transit Lambda).
- **SES** — email in sandbox mode initially (sender and recipients must be verified identities).
- **Web** — AWS Amplify Hosting building `apps/web` from GitHub on push.

Estimated baseline: ~$18–21/month (RDS ~$15, fck-nat ~$3.3, rest pennies at MVP traffic).

## Payments (Stripe, live mode)

- `PaymentProvider` backend switched by `FUTUREROOTS_PAYMENT_BACKEND` (`local` in dev, `stripe` in prod). Keys live in `infra/.env` (`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`) → Lambda env; the publishable key is a public Amplify env var (`NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`).
- Settlement happens **only** via the signature-verified `POST /webhooks/stripe` (webhook endpoint `we_1Ts44zAXijaNn5C5yVSHU2UT` in the Stripe dashboard, events: `payment_intent.succeeded`/`payment_failed`). The local `/confirm` endpoint refuses in stripe mode.
- Key rotation: update `infra/.env`, `cdk deploy`; publishable key via Amplify console + rebuild.
- Refunds: Stripe dashboard → refund the payment; then add a compensating `adjustment` ledger entry (there is no automated refund webhook handling yet — see hardening backlog).

## Secrets

`infra/.env` (gitignored, never committed): `DB_PASSWORD`, `JWT_SECRET`, `SES_FROM_ADDRESS`, `WEB_BASE_URL`. Rotate by editing and redeploying. Hardening TODO (Phase 5+): move to Secrets Manager + rotation.

## Deploy / update

```powershell
# 1. Package the API for Lambda (from apps/api)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\package_lambda.ps1

# 2. Deploy (from infra/)
npx cdk deploy --require-approval never

# 3. Run migrations inside the VPC (function name from stack output ApiFunctionName)
aws lambda invoke --function-name <ApiFunctionName> `
  --payload '{\"futureroots_command\":\"migrate\"}' `
  --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out out.json
```

Stack outputs: `ApiUrl`, `MediaBucketName`, `DbEndpoint`, `ApiFunctionName`.

## SES sandbox

While sandboxed, both the FROM address and every recipient must be verified:

```powershell
aws sesv2 create-email-identity --email-identity someone@example.com --region us-east-1
```

Request production access (SES console → Account dashboard) before inviting real families.

## Custom domain (futureroots.app)

- Domain registered at **Cloudflare** (Registrar) — nameservers must stay Cloudflare's, so DNS records live in the Cloudflare dashboard, all **DNS only** (grey cloud — proxying breaks ACM validation and double-proxies Amplify's CDN).
- Web: Amplify domain association for apex + www (`@` and `www` CNAME → the Amplify CloudFront host; ACM cert auto-managed by Amplify).
- API: ACM cert for `api.futureroots.app` + API Gateway custom domain + mapping to the HTTP API; `api` CNAME → the API GW regional target (`d-1oabzuff0d.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`).
- URLs: `https://futureroots.app` (web) · `https://api.futureroots.app` (API). `WEB_BASE_URL`/`EXTRA_ORIGINS` in `infra/.env` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in Amplify env vars must stay in sync with these.

## Web (Amplify Hosting)

Amplify app builds `apps/web` from the GitHub repo (monorepo root `apps/web`). After the first deploy, set `WEB_BASE_URL` in `infra/.env` to the Amplify URL and redeploy the stack so API CORS and email links point at it. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` env var in Amplify to the `ApiUrl` output.

## Post-deploy smoke test

`scripts/smoke_test.sh <ApiUrl>` (Git Bash) runs signup → family → child → invite → milestone → contribution against the deployed API.

## Hardening backlog (tracked for post-MVP)

- Cognito auth swap (needs an egress path for JWKS or a Cognito VPC endpoint)
- Secrets Manager for DB/JWT secrets
- CloudFront in front of API + custom domain + WAF
- RDS deletion protection on once real families are aboard
- GDPR erasure runbook (S3 cascade delete exists in code; document the operational flow)
